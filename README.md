# RockGen

RockGen is a Minecraft Forge mod for Minecraft 1.18.2 and 1.19.2. It provides recipes for controlling cobblestone
generation and other types of fluid interactions which create blocks, and dripstone based conversion.

By default, all standard vanilla interactions are preserved as recipes.

This mod is primarily intended for modpack creators.

## Supported features

- Override cobblestone, stone, basalt, and obsidian generation using recipes.
- Fluid -> Fluid interactions
- Fluid -> Block interactions
- Require interaction above specific block type (like with basalt)
- Random block outputs
- Override mud -> clay recipe and create new similar conversions.
