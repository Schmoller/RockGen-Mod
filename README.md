# RockGen

RockGen is a Minecraft Forge mod for Minecraft 1.18.2. It provides recipes for controlling cobblestone generation and
other types of fluid interactions which create blocks.

By default, all standard vanilla interactions are preserved as recipes.

This mod is primarily intended for modpack creators.

## Supported features

- Override cobblestone, stone, basalt, and obsidian generation using recipes.
- Fluid -> Fluid interactions
- Fluid -> Block interactions
- Require interaction above specific block type (like with basalt)
- Random block outputs

## Documentation

See the [Fluid interaction recipe guide](https://github.com/Schmoller/RockGen-Mod/wiki/Fluid-interaction-recipe-guide)
for information on how to create recipes.
